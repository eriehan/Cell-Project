This project implements a cellular automata simulator.

### Timeline

Start Date: 9/12/2019

Finish Date: 9/22/2019

Hours Spent:

### Primary Roles
Simulation (backend): Eric Han
* Implement a 2D grid of cells that is used to represent the simulation.
* Implement a simulation where the state information of each cell is updated each step based on rules applied to their state and those of their neighbors.
* Implement Java code for the rules of five different simulations: game of life (for testing), segregation, predator-prey, fire, and percolation 

Visualization: Junyu Liang
* Display the current states of the 2D grid and animate the simulation from its initial state until the user stops it.
* Allow users to load a new configuration file, which stops the current simulation and starts the new one.
* Allow users to pause and resume the simulation, as well as step forward through it.
* Allow users to speed up or slow down the simulation's animation rate.

Configuration: Diane Lin
* Read in an XML formatted file that contains the initial settings for a simulation. The file contains three parts:
    * kind of simulation it represents, as well as a title for this simulation and the author of this data file
    * settings for global configuration parameters specific to the simulation
    * width and height of the grid and the initial configuration of the states for the cells in the grid
